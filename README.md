# crossBrowserCompatibilityAndPre-Post-Processors

A three-page website built by following a Figma design prototype. The project demonstrates cross-browser compatibility and uses SCSS with partials, variables, and mixins for structured styling. The layout is implemented with Flexbox and CSS Grid, ensuring a modern design across different screen sizes.
